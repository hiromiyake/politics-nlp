    "# 1. Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, all the insights I derive here are based on the data at hand, so they only illuminate what is going on within the confines where the data came from. Extending the conclusions drawn here to other contexts may be inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first list the insights obtained. After this section, I describe the steps and code used to arrive at these insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insight 1: Republicans tweet about 'good', 'great', 'house' and 'tax', Democrats tweet about 'women', 'join', 'care' and 'family'\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight was gained by analyzing Twitter data. I applied standard text preprocessing to all of the tweets, used a bag of words approach along with term frequency-inverse document frequency (tfidf) and built a logistic regression model to predict the party of the tweeter. By examining the model coefficients, I was able to extract the most relevant words that predict party affiliation. From these words, it looks like Democrat tweets are more feminine and Republican tweets are more masculine, and the gender ratio of the two parties represented in the data are consistent with this view.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insight 2: Women tweet alike more than men tweet alike\n",
    "\n",
    "I compiled all the tweets for each person in the data set and performed k-means clustering on the text data to see how each user are close to each other. Naively you might expect the clusters would split along party lines, but the most interesting clustering seems to be one where all the women are in one cluster, and all the men are in their own separate clusters. So perhaps women have a more consistent Twitter messaging trend compared to men.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insight 3: Maryland bills that are enacted tend to be about replacing existing laws\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to determine the characteristics of bills that were enacted. This could be hugely useful for people who want certain laws enacted, because they can influence the bill so that it is likely to pass. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was hard to find anything definitive (otherwise I should probably start my own consulting company to help people pass bills). Nonetheless, a logistic regression model on the bill text and other features seem to suggest that bills that pass tend to have the word \"replace\" in them. To say anything definitive, more analysis is necessary, but at a high level, this may mean that it is easier to change existing law rather than creating a new law where there are no existing laws on the matter at hand. So if you want a new law passed, you might want to tie it into an existing law and replace it rather than try to get a completely new law enacted."

More positive the coefficient, the more strongly it predicts a Democrat, and more negative the coefficient, the more strongly it predicts a Republican. I also only want to consider statistically significant features, so I only consider those features with p-values less than $0.05/N$, where $N$ is the total number of features in the model. This is the Bonferroni correction, and is conservative but a quick way to deal with cases when you have many features, since by chance some may appear statistically significant."

If we make this a feature, we can predict the outcome with almost 100% accuracy, but this is meaningless, since laws that are enacted probably end up getting revised and necessarily have at least 3 revisions. Although this is mildly interesting to know, it most likely has no value in helping a bill be enacted. So I will not use this as a feature in the modeling. Furthermore, I will only take the last document for text analysis."
